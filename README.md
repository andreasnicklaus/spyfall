# Spyfall

**Welcome, Agent!**

You're a detective, but someone in your department is an enemy
spy. Everyone is invited to a social gathering. Everyone but the spy has gotten

### How to play

- **The location:** At the start of each round, a location of the gathering is chosen.
The location is the same for all players except for the spy. The spy is randomly selected
and given a blank "spy" card, so he/she won't know the round's location.
- **Questioning:** The game leader (organizer or the spy of the previous round) start by
questioning another player about the location. Example: "Do you think I can bring my partner?"
- **Answering:** The questioned player must answer. Follow-up questions are not allowed.
The answer should be specific enough to convince the other players that questioned player knows
the location, but vague enough so the spy cannot infer the location from the answer.
After the answer, the questioned player gets to ask another question.
- **No retaliation:** It is not allowed to pose a question to a player who just interrogated you!
You must choose someone else.

### The game ends...

There are 3 ways the round can end:

1. **No time left:** When the clock runs out, the spy remains undercover and wins the round. He/She
can now reveal himself/herself.
2. **Spy guess:** If at any point during the round the spy is certain to have found out the round's
location, the spy can reveal his/her role and guess the location. If the spy is right, he/she won
the round, otherwise the round is lost!
3. **Indictment:** The players can indict another player in a unanimous vote. If they cannot come
to an agreement (all but one players vote for a suspected spy), the questioning goes on.
If they vote out a player, who is not the spy, the spy wins! An indicted spy loses.

**Optional rule:** An indicted spy can still win if he/she has found out the location.
